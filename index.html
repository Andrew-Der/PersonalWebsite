    <h3 align="center">Internship with Apple</h3>
    <p id="job_description">During my 2016 summer, I was exposed to planning and architecting of standard cell library and IP release flows as well as QA methodologies across a wide variety of designs and technologies. I learned about generating IP related design views and defining verification coverage across a variety of design flows. My work encompassed Hard-IP, standard cell/IO libraries, PDKs and design kits from internal and external design teams and foundries. 
    I designed multiple scripts during the summer, utilizing perl, database query and injection, web languages and physical hardware views. I quickly absorbed the IP design flow, IP release process and multiple physical views and tools. While completing my work, I utilized collaboration, team work and communication with my team and Apple employees.</p>
    <h3 align="center">Internship with Texas Instruments</h3>
    <p id="job_description">For my 2015 summer, I was working under Applications with the Automation Processor Team in Sugar Land, Texas.  I developed an cross platform application using QT Software to log data every 50 milliseconds.  I also worked with TI hardware, language C and C++ projects, and explored my curiosity by asking and learning from engineers from other fields.
    My first project included integrating C files with existing infastrucutre to build a radio application on a prototype board.  For the second project, I designed an application to record the bits sent from the radio to tuner.  This application had filter, focus, hiding and logging capabilities allowing users to debug efficiently.</p>
    <h3 align="center">Language C Projects</h3>
    <p id="job_description">During my Winter 2016 quarter at Cal Poly, I enrolled into a Deep C and Systems Programming class (CPE 357).  This class focused on developing intensive C programs, coupled with Unix system commands.  The first project modeled a Laplace transform function using Unix forks, pipes and multiple processes.  At maximum, the program used 50 processes to simulate a rope burning with respect to time.  Pretty interesting!  The second project, I designed a test hardness program which maneuvers through a file system.  The final project, modeled the LZW Decompression Algorithm for regular text files All projects involve bit manipulation, forks, pipes and multiple processes.</p>
    <h3 align="center">Teaching Assisstant for Embedded Systems Course</h3>
    <p id="job_description">My responsibilities include completely understanding the course material (RAM, ROM, interrupts, signals, ALU's, counters, registers and etc.) and being able to clearly communicate their function and purpose to new students.  A large part of my job is also debugging student's work and fixing their code to run VHDL correctly on a Nexys 2 or 3 Board.  I love this job because I enjoy the topic and I get to help students learn and open their eyes to firmware.
